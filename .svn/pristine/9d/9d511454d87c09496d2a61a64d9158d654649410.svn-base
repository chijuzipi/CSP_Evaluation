% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Cross-site Scripting (XSS), a code injection attack that leverages the vulnerabilities of a web application to inject
malicious Javascript into the user web browsers,  is becoming one of the most common web-based attacks as a consequence
of the increasingly heavy reliance on complex web applications. 
Content Security Policy (CSP), a recently proposed web standard, is promising in mitigating the risk of XSS attacks. It
introduces black/white listing mechanism for the resources from different sources such that the malicious content can be
prevented from executing even if it is injected into the website. However, according to previous study from Chao, et .al
[2], few websites ranking in Alexa top 10,000 has CSP deployed in their server. Herein we design a flexible framework to
add middle layer between the server and client side to enforce the CSP on the websites in real time, and demonstrate how
this framework can enhance the protection of XSS attacks in real applications.

\section{Introduction}
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security issue typically found in web applications. By injecting
malicious Javascript into the web page, and execute the script at the client side, attacker can steal or inject
information, deface the website, plant malware and clickjacking. It is a major vulnerability on the web, which in charge
of 84\% security vulnerabilities document by Symantec since 2007 [1].
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a new type of defence aiming to protecting the web applications from XSS attacking and
other content injection vulnerabilities. For a specific web page, it allows web developers to explicitly specify the
normal behaviors of the websites and keep a whitelist of external sources introduced to dynamically generate web
contents. Consequently, the client equipped with a CSP-supported modern browser can detect the malicious scripts
injected externally and prevent them from running.
However, based on previous studies [2], very few sites from Alexa top 10, 000 websites uses the policy to reinforce
their services. Deploying CSP in the websites needs fair modifications on the server side, including refactoring the
inline Javascript as well as the text-to-Javascript methods, and defining CSP header in fine grain. Since CSP is only
proposed in few years and still in rapid development, it has yet been incorporated in most websites. Therefore, a
flexible middle layer that automatically enforces CSP to these sites before the clients receive the server responses can
greatly improve the security against the XSS attacks. Essentially CSP enables web-designer to whitelist the sources of a
page¿s executable scripts and styles. When there is no CSP available for a particular page, generating such policy based
on this page¿s trustful content will be necessary. To achieve this, we have developed the following strategies to build
up a complete whitelist of legitimate page contents:
collect and fingerprint the trustful page contents to ensure the all of the possible javascript and CSS styles are
recorded.
Update the existing white list regularly to adapt to the changes in the server side.    
A framework to filter the page contents of the incoming HTTP response from the server based on the whitelist generated
from the above strategies is developed and tested in this paper. Ideally this framework can be implemented as a software
layer in server side or client side, or as independent hardware between the server and clients, which provide great
flexibility in practical deployment.
\subsection{Related Works}
The most popular security policy is the same-origin policy (SOP) proposed by Jackson et al[3]. The policy define
separated sandbox for each web page domain, restrict the resources that each domain can access. Despite the huge success
in the SOP, it does not guard the XSS attack since the XSS can modify the victim domain web page by inject script
leaking the information by its own, which does not against the SOP principle. Another security system called
Browser-Enforced Authenticity Protection (BEAP) proposed by researchers at Purdue University [4], using browser to
manage  sensitive data, such as cookies. However, the flexibility of the browser automation limited the usage of BEAP.
CSP, on the other hand, is more restrictive than BEAP by only allowing access to whitelisted sources. 
For the previous EECS499 CSP project study, Chao Feng et al. found that only 26 out of 10,000 web pages from Alexa
implemented CSP. They implemented a program to automatically extract all inline script, generating CSP header and simple
script template. However, the template only contain the function name from the script, and cannot be used to check the
structure of the script. Finally, a tentative proxy to transfer the page without CSP to that with CSP is implemented,
which may serve a good foundation of this study to implement a fully operational proxy that add CSP layer to major web
pages  from Alexa top list. 


\section{Approach}
\subsection{Overview}
Our strategy is to build a proxy between the server and client to ensure that the web content received by the client has
CSP applied and inline script secured. For each page sent to the client, the proxy will process the HTML content
according to the CSP policy before sending to client. In the same time, the proxy will maintain a abstract template
fingerprint. Specifically, the operation includes: 
Extract all inline scripts and styles into an external file; 
Compare the external file with the template for this page that has been collected and constructed previously; 
Filter and remove undesired scripts, generating warning report; 
Properly connect the external script and styles to the HTML elements; 
Generating CSP header, according to the HTML external source linkers. 
One function of the system is that the inline and implicit javascripts should be totally avoided and converted to
explicit javascript files, which follow the requirements of CSP. Another function of the system is to make sure if this
page is maliciously modified by adding extra javascript, the proxy will ignore these changes and only execute the
desired scripts, based on the maintained template. 

\subsection{Secured content template design}
To represent the identity of the script associated with a webpage, several assumptions have to be made for Alexa top
websites without regular updates:
Script is divided into individual units from the content page, and each unit is maintained atomically. 
eg. each script block contained within a <script> tag is a unit, so does 
each inline script associate with a trigger event. 
All script unit in a page will form a script pool, this pool tend to be static.
script units presenting in a web page are subset of the pool.
the pool is consisted of statically and dynamically generated scripts units
A repeat sampling method can help to construct the script pool.
The number, location, property of script presenting in a page can be dynamic. Dynamically generated DOM contents is
frequent, therefore the script units¿ property (xpath, attribute, tag, etc. ) will be changing frequently.   
The malicious XSS attack can only happen when new script is introduced. The DOM structure can be changed when the URL,
text input, etc., are programmed on purpose, but only when extra scripts contents are included and executed should the
attack be effective.
Based on these assumptions, we have designed the template to be a JSON file. Based on the nature of the script unit, the
file is divided into three categories: 

External script unit:
  \textless script type="text/javascript" src="test.js"\textgreater \textless/script\textgreater

Block script unit:
  \textless script type="text/javascript" \textgreater
    function myfunction() \{
      ... 
    \}
  \textless /script \textgreater

Inline script unit:
  \textless button onclick="myfunction()"\textgreater button\textless/button\textgreater

The identification of each script unit is based on its content string. Thereby a SHA1 of the content string is
generated and used as key for each item in the JSON file, this key is a direct representation of the content of the
script, and will be used for script behavior identification. The value of each item is the associated property list
of each script unit, including tag name, attributes, trigger event and xpath. The property of script unit is to
track how the unit mutate within the DOM structure. For each page URL, there will be one JSON file generated in the
sampling stage, which will be used as template. A example JSON template is attached at the end of the report. 

\subsection{Filtration of Undesired Scripts and Generation of Warning Report}
JSON template will be generated in the sampling stage and saved into the proxy¿s local storage. The proxy then can
screen the received HTML file according to the existing template in the local storage. Based on the assumption that the
script content pool tend to static, a complete collection of the possible script content units can be simply pulled
from the JSON files by extracting all keys. This collection will serve as a white list. If the content of the script
unit from newly received HTML file is a subset of the white list, then it is considered safe. If a script content unit
is not part of the white list, then it is considered unsafe and will be removed , along with a warning report
generated. 
The associated property of a script unit also will be examined based on template, however, it is not considered
critical in determining the applicability of the script (the content of the script is the only criterion). For the
purpose of tracking how the associated properties of the script unit mutate, a log file will be generated once new
property discovered for an existing key, and the template will be updated to incorporate the new property. 


\subsection{Implementation}
Using Java, the implemented program structure is demonstrated in Figure 2. Each square represents a class and has
function as following: 
  CSPApplier: The main class to execute the program, it contains multiple classes.
  URLContentAnalyzer: Parse HTML DOM elements and generate SHA1-sum ID of the input URL.
  
  HashMapGenerator: Based on the parsed page element, generate SHA1-sum ID of the script unit, mapping the ID to script
  properties. 

  SHA ID: for each script unit, there will be one SHA hash code generated based on the content of the script. The SHA hash
  code is the script unit ID. 

  ID-Script property list Hash Map: a ID to script property list 1 to 1 mapping.
  Json file: The Json file is for the purpose of storing each script unit related information, such as script unit ID,
  script tag name, type, source, class, etc.
Note: Each URL will have one Json file as the web page template and will be saved to local database. 

  HashMapInJson: convert the hash map into Json format using open source library gSON. 

  JsonAnalyzer: compare the current web-page¿s Json with its corresponding template and generate comparison results. Thecomparison algorithm is designed as following:

As demonstrate in the above table, the analyzer first look if the template is exist, if it is not, then it will not
modify the JSON file. In the case that the template does exist, the analyzer will screen each script unit in the newly
generated JSON file, examining if the script unit¿s SHA exist in the template SHA pool. If it does not, then the
analyzer will remove the script unit and generate a issue report. If it does, then the analyzer will look if the
property-SHA pair of the script unit also exist in the template. If it does not, then the script will still be kept,
the template will be updated, and a update report will be generated. If it does, then the script will be kept, and
nothing else will be done.  

  HTMLGenerator: Generate new HTML/JS/CSS files according of results from the comparison result and original HashMap
  from previous two analyzers

  CSPGenerator: Generate CSP header according to the HTML external files.

\subsection{Updating Template}
These generated templates should be updated regularly in response to the changes of the web pages in the server.
However, this updating frequency should also be limited in a certain range to avoid unnecessary burden for the proxy. A
measurement to track how fast these templates will change for alexa top 10,000 websites can be therefore conducted to
obtain a reasonable range of updating frequency. 

\section{Mechanism of Defending XSS Attacks}
The main mechanism to defending XSS attack of using the content security policy is by only executing developer expected
scripts. Generally, there are three types of XSS attacks that are most common: 

  Persistent XSS, where the malicious string originates from the website's database.
  Reflected XSS, where the malicious string originates from the victim's request.
  DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. 

For persistent and reflected XSS, the CSP Applier can simple filter the injected script based on the local template and
the proxy generated new script file will not contain any injected script. For the DOM-based XSS, the injected script is
dynamically generated after the HTML file is loaded by browser, therefore will not be filtered by Proxy. But the CSP
will block any execution of inline scripts leading to successful defence of the attack. 

\section{Results and Discussions}
\subsection{Browsing Normal Webpages}
blablabla

\subsection{Generation of Templates for Webpages}
Under sampling mode, the proxy successfully generate the template for the page visited, an example is showing below
INSERT THE JSON FILE

\subsection{XSS Attack Defence on Fabricated Pages}
To test the correctness of the implementation, we have created dummy web pages for the program to execute on. The
testing files is attached as supporting information of this report in the file ¿test.zip¿, which will be submitted
seperately. 
The goal of this study is to make the web pages without CSP protection safer by implementing them with Content Safety
Policy. 
Specifically, we will implement a system that automatically generate a CSP policy for each page and apply it when
loaded. This need to be done by a proxy framework, which can process the web page, generate the policy, store the policy
and reapply it when the web page is loaded again. The proxy can also detect malicious script modifications and inform
the server. 
The study should achieve automatically implementation of CSP to the Alexa top 10,000 web page and make them less
vulnerable.



% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
